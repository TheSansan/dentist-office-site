# Falls Park Dentistry Site #
=============
This is my first site project for class. It's for a local dentist office in downtown Greenville. 

I did a lot of research about the dentist office before starting the site. I made a client interview template, competitive Market study, and content stategy.

After that  I did wireframes and 3 different styletiles in Illustrator, and then I chose the styletile of the three that I thought stood out the most.

And then I learned HTML and CSS in class. I coded the wireframes and styletiles in HTML and CSS.

And this is the site that I built. 

I also make a logo for the dentist in Illustrator, and created line art from a falls park picture for the site header in photoshop.

The next thing I'm going to do is using SCSS to make the  site more consistent and organized.
